# Task 1

We need 4 different values for this task:

    1. Unique Victim Identifier
    2. Encrypted Ransom Key
    3. One-time Passcode (OTP)
    4. Escrow Contract Address

Values 1 and 4 are the easiest, so let's start with those. The victim ID is given in the ransom file:
```
include your unique identification value: 0xb05d1d5c69459b0ef424a213f1c11d0afd53d070df8b69ac041584c3af9dba8c
```
So is the contract address: 
```
the Escrow contract at address: 0x0bb8D9a961cF6789244130f6C4f922C414Fde651
```
Now we just need to find the encrypted key and OTP.
