A JSON RPC service is available for you to connect to using standard "web3" tools.  Please do not try to hack this service.
Note, it is only available using an HTTP connection, *not* WebSockets.  Other useful information for using the network is below.

Typical Gas Price: 22 GWei
Blocks Mined every 5 seconds (average)

Your account address: 0x13495A46D4de87020753e3178462044672513e7a
(See other downloads for keystore/password)

To test your connectivity, you can try the following example adapted from: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#eth_blocknumber

You should see a working response with an increasing block number (result) after a few seconds.

Take note of the explicit "Content-Type" header being passed to curl.  This is
required for Parity Ethereum, but not all Ethereum clients so you may find it missing from other examples.
See the Parity JSON RPC API Wiki for more: https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC

curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" $URL

# Example Result (it wont match exactly)
{
  "id":1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x32c8" # ie. 13000, try again later and see a higher value
}

One last note.  Remember, every account on our network also exists on every other Ethereum network.
You should definitely *not* reuse the same accounts on different networks without being very careful.
